## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Start a new tic tac toe game
- Click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- Be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
- Not be able to click the same square twice
- Shown a message when I win, lose or tie
- Not be able to continue playing once I win, lose, or tie
- Play the game again without refreshing the page
- **Bonus**: Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win, lose and tie counter

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Grid System - Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/) - This website helped me to execute some of the styling that I created in the wireframe. This also helped with the gameboard formatting and easy spacing within the style of the game.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This site helped me with understanding certain methods for arrays and how to utitlize them in my code

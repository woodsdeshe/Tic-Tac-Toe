## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Start a new tic tac toe game
- Click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
- Be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next

### What I learned
- I struggled with how to handle the removal of the 
```js
//This function resets the game
function resetGame() {
  tile.forEach((square) => {
    square.textContent = "";
    square.classList.remove("x-symbol");
    square.classList.remove("o-symbol");
  });
  message.textContent = "Press Start to Play";
  currentPlayer = "X";
  gameOver = false;
}
```
```css
.x-symbol {
    color: #b87bf1;
    background-color: #b87bf152;
}

.o-symbol {
    color: #53f0c1;
    background-color: #53f0c18c;
}
```
```html
 <div class="container game-board">
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-4">
                <div class="tile square-1"></div>
              </div>
              <div class="col-4">
                <div class="tile square-2"></div>
              </div>
              <div class="col-4">
                <div class="tile square-3"></div>
              </div>
            </div>
```

### Useful resources

- [Grid System - Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/grid/) - This website helped me to execute some of the styling that I created in the wireframe. This also helped with the gameboard formatting and easy spacing within the style of the game.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This site helped me with understanding certain methods for arrays and how to utitlize them in my code
